Hi, my name is Uijeong Jang. I am a Master's Student in SNU math department, under the supervision of Professor Ernest K. Ryu.

I am interested in mathematical optimization and its applications to practical problems in deep learning. My current work focuses on the performance estimation of first-order methods and low-rank adaptation.
