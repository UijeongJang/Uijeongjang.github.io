Hi, my name is Uijeong Jang. I am a Master's Student in SNU math department, under the supervision of Professor Ernest K. Ryu (currently at UCLA).

I am interested in mathematical optimization theory and applications of them to practical settings in deep learning theory. My concurrent work is closely related to performance estimation of first order methods and low-rank adaptation.
